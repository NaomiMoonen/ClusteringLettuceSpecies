# ClusteringLettuceSpecies
Code to reproduce the clustering in the paper Masereeuw et al. (2022).

The code uses as input an Excel file with 'Experiment' as first column and the name of an experiment as value. 
In this paper, these values were Inulin-FITC, ZO-1, PrestoBlue, Nuclei count, Alkaline Phosphatase, IL-6, IL-8, NO.

The second column, named 'Number', indicates the experimental run.

The remaining columns refer to different lettuce types that were tested.
The values in these columns correspond to the result of an experimental run for this lettuce type.
